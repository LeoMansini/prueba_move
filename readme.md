# EPA on contract written on Move

## Setup

This repo includes the [Move on Sui](https://github.com/move-language/move-sui) repo as a git submodule, which is a
fork from the original Move repo, created after the Move split in Sui and Aptos flavors. It's not updated to the latest changes
in the Sui blockchain/CLI, but that means the move prover is still present.

Run

```{shell}
bash setup_script.sh
```

to install move-cli, move-prover and necessary packages.

Some nice move prover examples [here](https://github.com/Zellic/move-prover-examples).
